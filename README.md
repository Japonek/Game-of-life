Game of Life

The aim of this exercise is to write a simple application in JavaScript that will show an interactive animation based on one of the first and best known examples of the cellular automaton, invented in 1970 by British mathematician John Conway. We will write in pure JavaScript, based on the assumptions of object oriented programming.

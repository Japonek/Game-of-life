Game of Life

Rules

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


The aim of this exercise is to write a simple application in JavaScript that will show an interactive animation based on one of the first and best known examples of the cellular automaton, invented in 1970 by British mathematician John Conway. We will write in pure JavaScript, based on the assumptions of object oriented programming.
